This repo contains an algorithm that identifies vendors whose customers have a higher willingness to pay. The inherent inelasticity of these vendors is utilized as part of a price differentiation strategy called "Loved Brands"

# Introduction to the Strategy
In the **online delivery space**, customers open an app such as Uber Eats and order food, groceries, and other consumables from restaurants/shops. Businesses charge these customers a delivery fee to get the order delivered to their doorstep. One way to **differentiate the pricing strategy** for these vendors is to identify those who have a **lower elasticity of demand** due to the **vendor's brand equity** and **customer loyalty**.

The elasticity of demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in pricing and it is calculated using this formula --> `${% Change in Orders / % Change in Price}`
