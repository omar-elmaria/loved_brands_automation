/*
This script curates the "Loved Brands" for all countries and ASAs
V3 includes the patch that links the parent to its child
V3_Linted_Deployed to GitHub is the same as V3 but with the formatting rules applied
V4_Linted_Deployed includes a fix for how CVR3 is calculated --> Exclude event_time from the numerator
V5_Linted_Deployed has a new way of calculating elasticities based on linear regression
