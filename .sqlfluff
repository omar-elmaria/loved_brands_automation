# L027 - References should be qualified if select has more than one referenced table/view.
# -> This rule is not very advanced and doesn't support nested fields well, which we use al ot.
# L029 - Keywords should not be used as identifiers
# -> Using unreserved keywords in BigQuery poses no problem at all. Also, when dealing with external
# data sources we not always have control over field names. Enabling this rule will yield to a lot
# lint errors and the gain is very little.
# L032 - Prefer specifying join keys instead of using USING.
# -> No, we dont. Actually we prefer USINGs over JOIN
# L034 - Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates.
# -> This rule is incompatible with some of the stuff we do in Datahub
# L044 - Query produces an unknown number of result columns.
# -> We use CTA with SELECT * a lot.
# L060 - Use COALESCE instead of IFNULL or NVL.
# -> No! The reason behind this rule is because COALESCE is universally supported while IFNULL is not.
# But we don't care about whether other databases can run our queries.
# Let users write the SQL in most easy to understand way.
